laser-jewelry
=============

An open collection of jewelry designs for laser cutters/engravers from BuildBrighton hackspace.

Source files are all in SVG format which can be opened in most modern browsers and edited using Inkscape (or other vector illustration packages).

Unless otherwise specified within the SVG file, red & black lines are for cutting, blue for scoring. Black lines should be cut last as they are the outer cut, pieces may fall out & other cuts may be mis-aligned if the ordering isn't correct.

Where an SVG file has an accompanying PNG file this is for etching ontop of the jewelry.
