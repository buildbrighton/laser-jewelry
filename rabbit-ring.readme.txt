The rabbit ring consists of three layers 
 * Head outline bottom (white): the white bottom layer containing the rabbit's ears
 * Head outline middle (black): a middle black layer with the rabbit's ear-holes & infil for the eyes & nose
 * Top Layer: a white front-layer with the rabbit's face

Each of these is a layer in the SVG file when opened within inkscape. 
Show one layer at a time when cutting the parts otherwise you will end up with a mess of tiny rabbit bits.
As with the other designs, red & black are for cutting (black last) & blue is for scoring/etching.

Once all three pieces have been cut out, glue them together in the correct order. 
If using acrylic I recommend a solvent cement to bond them.

Toby.
